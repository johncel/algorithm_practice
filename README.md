# What is this?

A collection of interesting interview type problems and solutions I've been working through.

* `./bits.py` - Bit manipulation in Python
* `./heap.py` - Practive with creating/inserting/deleting from heaps
* `./reverse_string_recurse.py` - Reverse a string recursively, but why? 'cause text book recursion is important...
* `./gen.py` - hello-world generator to show how one can use generators to make a pipeline
* `./property.py` - practive with property w.r.t classes
* `./symmetric.py` - tree symmetry, but incorrectly defined as 'the shape of branching of two subtrees is the same, not the node values' ... oops
* `./binary_tree_from_sorted_list.py` - create a balanced binary tree from a sorted list
* `./beta.py` - fun with beta distributions
* `./sort.py` - sorting via merge sort and quick sort
* `./equation_n_time.py` - solve an equation of the form `x*y-z/m`
* `./linked_list.py` - linked lists in python, worse than lists, but an academic exercise none-the-less
* `./intersecting__bb/intersecting_bb.py` - given two bounding boxes, do they overlap?
* `./permutations.py` - compute permutations recursively
* `./divide_conquer.py` - find closest pair of numbers on a number line
* `./postgres/` - example simple docker-compose postgres server and client
* `./file.py` - prints a directory tree
* `./longest_non_repeating_substr.py` - given a random strong, find the longest substring that does not contain repeating characters
* `./reference_remember.py` - shows one of the annoying issues with Python... optional args sometimes persist!
* `./exception_ex.py` - simple example of exception handling
* `./permutations_1.py` - another permutation generator using recursion
* `./equation_1.py` - O(n^2) version of simple equation solver
* `./inheritance_2.py` - demonstrations in class inheretance, multiple inheritance
* `./object_copy.py` - demonstration of object copying
* `./t_profile.py` - demonstration of the built-in profiler... Wish I had known about this in my last gig...
* `./longest_palidrome_substr.py` - given a random string, find the longest palindrome... O(n^2)
* `./inheritance.py` - demonstrations in class inheretance
